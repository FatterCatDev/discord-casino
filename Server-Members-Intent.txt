Server Member Intent

The client opts into GatewayIntentBits.GuildMembers (src/index.mjs:142) because the casino has to reason about real member records—role changes, permission revocations, and membership churn directly affect who may move chips or manage tables.
Admin-facing commands examine the invoking member’s live permissions (e.g. interaction.memberPermissions in src/commands/setgamelogchannel.mjs:7) so only Discord administrators or registered casino staff can run /setgamelogchannel, /setcashlog, /setrequestchannel, /setupdatech, etc. That permission snapshot is delivered through the GUILD_MEMBERS payload; without the intent we lose the data needed to gate currency-moving actions.
Before accepting any new log/request/update channel, we fetch the bot’s own GuildMember (interaction.guild.members.fetchMe() in src/commands/setgamelogchannel.mjs:21, src/commands/setcashlog.mjs:22, src/commands/setrequestchannel.mjs:21, src/commands/setupdatech.mjs:26) to confirm it already has ViewChannel/SendMessages. Discord blocks these member fetches when the Server Member intent is absent, so the safety check would fail.
The update broadcaster double-checks the cached guild.members.me entry and re-fetches it if needed (src/services/updates.mjs:46) before pushing version announcements. Those lookups depend on receiving GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE events for the bot and on the same fetchMe() route, both gated by the Server Member intent; losing that data would make us post into channels where we no longer have permission.
