# 🎉 Welcome to Semuta Casino 🎰

Just landed in the casino? Here’s your quick-start guide to earning chips, playing games, and staying on top of the action.

---

## 🚪 1. First Steps
1. 📜 **Read the house rules** – check any pinned messages or rules channels the staff highlight.
2. 🧭 **Run `/help`** – you’ll get a menu tailored to your role (player/mod/admin). Browse the “Player” section first.
3. 💱 **Learn the currencies**
   • 💳 Credits: used first when betting.
   • 💰 Chips: universal currency; all winnings are paid out in chips.

---

## 💎 2. Grab Your Starting Chips
• 🎡 **Daily bonus** — `/dailyspin` (free chips every 24 hours)  
• 🗳️ **Vote for the casino** — `/vote` (Top.gg & DiscordBotList links; rewards credit automatically with a DM)  
• 📬 **Request help** — `/request type:<Buy In|Cash Out> amount:<int>` (staff-assisted buy-ins or cash-outs)  
• 🎲 **Play games** — `/ridebus`, `/blackjack`, `/slots`, `/roulette`, `/dicewar`, `/holdem` (Credits stake first; chips are the payout)

💡 Tip: Keep an eye on your DMs—vote rewards land automatically with a shiny receipt!

---

## 🧰 3. Essential Commands
• 🆘 `/help` — interactive help menu  
• 💼 `/balance [user]` — check chip/credit balance (mods can check others)  
• 🏆 `/leaderboard [limit]` — see the top chip holders

---

## 🕹️ 4. Pick a Game
• 🚌 **Ride the Bus** — `/ridebus bet:<int>` (ladder Q1–Q4; cash out after Q3 if you’re cautious)  
• 🃏 **Blackjack** — `/blackjack table:<High|Low> bet:<int>` (classic blackjack vs. the house)  
• 🎰 **Slots** — `/slots bet:<int>` (20-line slot machine; Credits stake first, chips pay out)  
• 🎡 **Roulette** — `/roulette` (interactive bets with a live wheel spin)  
• ⚔️ **Dice War** — `/dicewar bet:<int>` (simple roll vs. the house; winning doubles pay 2×)  
• ♠️ **Texas Hold’em** — `/holdem` (spin up a private table; hole cards DM’d to you)

---

## 💳 5. Watching Your Balance
• 📊 `/balance` — shows your chips and credits  
• 🏦 `/housebalance` (mods) — check the house vault  
• 🏅 `/leaderboard` — see who’s on a hot streak

_Remember: games burn Credits first, then dip into your chips. Wins add chips back to your stack!_

---

## 🙋 6. Need Staff Assistance?
• 📨 Use `/request` for buy-ins or cash-outs  
• 🔔 Ping moderators for account questions  
• 👥 Check `/stafflist` to see who’s in charge

---

## 🗳️ 7. How Voting Works (Player View)
• `/vote` shows all active voting links  
• Click a link → vote on Top.gg or DiscordBotList  
• Rewards credit automatically—no “claim” button needed  
• The bot DMs you the amount, so keep DMs enabled

---

## 🔁 8. Keep the Streak Going
• ⏰ Check in daily (`/dailyspin`)  
• 🔄 Vote every 12 hours (Top.gg) and whenever DBL allows  
• 🎉 Join games when the house is active to grow your chip stack

---

## 🧩 9. Something Not Working?
• 🚨 Tell a moderator right away  
• 🔄 If slash commands glitch, try `/help` again or ask an admin to reauthorize the bot  
• 📚 Staff can review logs (`#casino-game-log`, `#casino-cash-log`, etc.) for deeper issues

Enjoy the tables, and good luck on your next big score! 💰💫
