# Semuta Casino Bot – Terms of Service

_Last updated: October 15, 2025_

Semuta Casino (the “Bot”) is a Discord application that provides virtual casino-style games and a shared in-bot economy. By inviting or using the Bot, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not add or use the Bot.

## 1. Eligibility & Discord Compliance
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times.
- You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Bot. Server owners are responsible for restricting access in their communities.
- By using the Bot on behalf of a server or organisation, you confirm you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

## 2. Virtual Economy
- Chips and Credits are **virtual, non-redeemable** items with no cash value. They may not be bought, sold, traded for, or redeemed as real currency, goods, or services inside or outside Discord.
- Game results, leaderboards, and payouts are determined programmatically. The Bot does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
- Staff commands (e.g. `/buyin`, `/cashout`, `/houseadd`, `/houseremove`) adjust balances within the virtual economy only.

## 3. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Circumvent rate limits, exploit bugs, or automate interactions that overload the Bot.
- Engage in harassment, hate speech, or other conduct that violates Discord’s policies or the rules of any guild where the Bot is present.
- Use the Bot to facilitate real-money gambling, wagers, or raffles of any kind.
- Copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer the Bot’s code or assets without permission.

## 4. Server Owner & Moderator Responsibilities
- Guild administrators who grant staff access are responsible for supervising the use of moderation commands and for notifying users that the economy is virtual-only.
- The Bot relies on guild-provided permissions (e.g. request channels, logging channels). Misconfiguration may prevent buy-in, cash-out, or erasure workflows from completing; the project team is not liable for losses caused by misconfiguration.
- Staff may freeze or reset balances, deny requests, or remove users from games when necessary to maintain operational integrity.

## 5. Data Requests & Account Closure
- Players can submit `/request type:Erase Account Data notes:<reason>` to purge their stored data. Moderators may deny requests that lack sufficient verification.
- When an erasure request is approved, the Bot deletes user wallet records, transactions, job progress, vote reward entries, session data, and removes the user from moderator/admin lists. Residual logs or aggregate statistics may remain in anonymised form.
- If you leave a guild where the Bot operates, your economy profile remains active until an erasure request is completed.

## 6. Warranties & Liability
- The Bot is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. Use is at your own risk.
- Neither the project maintainers nor associated contributors are liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the Bot, including lost virtual progress or moderation decisions.
- Total liability for any claim will not exceed USD $50.

## 7. Changes to these Terms
- The maintainers may update these Terms at any time. Material updates will be announced via the configured update channels or the project repository.
- Continued use of the Bot after revisions take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 8. Contact
For questions or concerns about these Terms, contact the economy owner (Discord ID `94915805375889408`) or open an erasure/request ticket via `/request`.

By using Semuta Casino you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.
