# Semuta Casino Bot – Terms of Service

_Last updated: October 22, 2025_

Semuta Casino (the “Bot”) is a Discord application that delivers virtual casino-style entertainment, a global house ledger, and cross-server progression. By inviting, configuring, or using the Bot, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not add or use the Bot.

## 1. Eligibility & Discord Compliance
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times.
- The Bot is intended for individuals aged 18 or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. Server owners are responsible for restricting access accordingly.
- If you enable the Bot on behalf of a guild, organisation, or community, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

## 2. Service Description
- The Bot powers Semuta Casino’s shared economy, including Chips, Credits, global leaderboards, buy-in/cash-out requests, and the house vault operated by the economy owner.
- Entertainment features include slash-command games (Ride the Bus, Blackjack, Slots, Roulette, Dice War, Horse Race, Texas Hold’em), the single-stage job system (Bartender, Dealer, Bouncer), daily and vote rewards, and logging dashboards for moderators.
- Sessions, payouts, and job rewards are calculated automatically. Gameplay data, session summaries, and request updates may be posted to configured log channels for transparency.
- Maintain access to Discord’s API and to the Bot itself is not guaranteed. Features may change, pause, or be removed at the maintainers’ discretion.

## 3. Virtual Economy
- Chips and Credits are virtual items with zero real-world monetary value. They cannot be bought, sold, traded for, or redeemed as real currency, goods, or services inside or outside Discord.
- Balances, job progress, cooldowns, and request history are stored in a single global ledger that follows users across every guild where the Bot operates.
- Staff commands (e.g. `/request`, `/houseadd`, `/houseremove`, `/setrake`, `/setcasinocategory`) adjust the in-bot economy only. Moderators must not represent virtual payouts as real money.
- Coverage checks may deny a game or request when the House vault cannot cover potential payouts; this safeguard is part of the normal service.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Automate, script, or otherwise interact with the Bot in ways that exceed documented rate limits or attempt to exploit bugs.
- Use the Bot to facilitate real-money gambling, raffles, lotteries, or wagers of any kind.
- Harass other users, share hateful content, or violate the rules of any guild that hosts the Bot.
- Falsify requests, impersonate other users, or interfere with moderator investigations.
- Copy, distribute, or reverse engineer Bot code or assets without explicit permission from the maintainers.

## 5. Server Owner & Moderator Responsibilities
- Configure the Bot’s required permissions, casino category, request channel, and logging channels so workflows (buy-in, cash-out, data erasure) can complete. Misconfiguration may prevent settlements and is not the maintainers’ liability.
- Review and act on `/request` tickets (buy-ins, cash-outs, erasure) promptly. Moderators may deny a request when verification fails or policy violations occur.
- Monitor House balances, request logs, and job payouts to ensure fair play within the community.
- Communicate to players that the economy is virtual-only and that chips/credits have no cash value.

## 6. Player Responsibilities
- Respect published bet limits, job stamina rules, session timers, and cooldowns. Sessions expire after inactivity to protect the economy; expired games forfeit unresolved actions.
- Keep your Discord account secure. The maintainers are not responsible for losses caused by compromised accounts or shared devices.
- Report bugs, exploits, or suspicious activity to moderators or the economy owner rather than abusing them.

## 7. Data & Privacy
- The Bot stores Discord identifiers, wallet balances, transaction history, job progress, vote rewards, request tickets, and gameplay/session metadata required to run the service.
- Log channels may display usernames, wagers, and results so staff can audit activity.
- Additional details are available in the Semuta Casino Privacy Policy. Using the Bot signifies your agreement to that policy and to the data practices described there.

## 8. Account Closure & Erasure
- Submit `/request type:Erase Account Data notes:<reason>` to ask for deletion of your stored data. Moderators may require verification before approving a ticket.
- When an erasure request is approved, wallet balances, transaction history, job progress, vote rewards, request records, and moderator/admin assignments for your user ID are purged from the active database. Aggregated or anonymised data may be retained for analytics and integrity.
- Leaving a guild does not automatically remove your data. Your profile remains active across other guilds until an approved erasure completes.

## 9. Suspension & Termination
- The maintainers may suspend or terminate access to the Bot, specific commands, or data features at any time for policy violations, security concerns, or technical reasons.
- Guild administrators may disable or remove the Bot at their discretion. Removing the Bot does not delete stored data without an erasure request.

## 10. Warranties & Liability
- The Bot is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Use the Bot at your own risk.
- The maintainers are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the Bot, including lost virtual progress, denied requests, or moderation outcomes.
- To the fullest extent permitted by law, total liability for any claim related to the Bot will not exceed USD $50.

## 11. Changes to These Terms
- The maintainers may update these Terms when features, policies, or legal requirements change. Material updates will be announced via the configured update channel or the project repository.
- Continued use of the Bot after revisions take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 12. Contact
For questions or concerns about these Terms, contact the economy owner (Discord ID `94915805375889408`) or submit a `/request` ticket in a guild that hosts the Bot.

By using Semuta Casino you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.
