🧪 **NEW: The Semuta Cartel — Passive Income for Your Entire Casino**

The *brand-new* Semuta Cartel system turns Discord Casino into a living idle economy. Drop the update, run `/cartel`, and your staff unlock a fresh experience where Semuta shards, cartel shares, dealer codenames, and XP chase each other in an endless loop of strategy and payouts.

---

### 💠 NEW Semuta Shares: Invest, Sell, and Hoard
- `/cartel` opens a real-time command console showing stash, warehouse overflow, share price, and per-share production.
- The **Invest** modal pulls live share pricing per guild so whales can buy in at local market rates and see their hourly/daily grams of Semuta update instantly.
- **Sell Stash** converts grams of Semuta to chips with bank-grade receipts, while **Collect Warehouse** drains overflow so every gram of Semuta works for you.

### 🧬 Upgraded Dealer Network: Hire, Pay, Fire, Repeat
- Three-tab **Dealers** view (List / Hire / Upkeep) covers the entire roster without leaving the embed.
- Each tier carries bespoke hire costs, hourly sell caps, and upkeep percentages—perfect for roleplay “cartel promotion” nights.
- Pending chips pile up automatically; one **Collect Chips** press pays every dealer, grants XP, and updates the rank ladder.

### ⏱ Upkeep & Automation: Never Miss a Tick
- Dealers auto-attempt upkeep pulls when timers expire; out of chips? They pause instead of vanishing.
- `/cartel overview` shows the exact formula: base rate × pool share × tick length, so staff can diagnose every blip.
- Admin sliders (`/setcartelshare`, `/setcartelrate`, `/setcartelxp`) rebalance the entire cartel mid-season without a redeploy.

### 🧯 Safety Nets & Quality of Life
- First-time winners get a Semuta DM pitch so newbies discover `/cartel` the moment they prove they can win.
- Dealer codenames persist across the entire system—no more ID guessing when staff talk strategy.
- Chip stakes from timed-out blackjack or Ride the Bus sessions automatically refund, keeping the passive economy drama-free.
