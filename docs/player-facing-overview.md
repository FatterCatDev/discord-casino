# Discord Casino Bot — Player Overview

The Discord Casino Bot turns any server into a cross-guild casino lounge with a shared bankroll, fast-paced games, and long-term progression. Whether you jump in for a quick round of Blackjack or sink hours into the job system, every chip you earn and every rank you unlock follows you wherever the bot lives.

## What Is Semuta Casino?
- Semuta Casino is the in-universe brand that powers the bot’s global house—think of it as the cross-server casino floor where every table, race, and job shift is connected.
- The Semuta economy owner safeguards the vault, orchestrates minting and burning, and keeps the shared ledger healthy so payouts are always ready to go.
- All jobs, leaderboards, and reward programs report into Semuta Casino, so no matter which community you join, you’re playing under the same trusted banner with consistent rules and fair play monitoring.

## Why Players Keep Coming Back
- Global wallets mean your chips, credits, and job stats move with you across every server that runs the bot.
- Slick slash commands drive the entire experience—no clunky prefixes or guesswork, just `/balance`, `/play`, and go.
- Interactive embeds update in real time with timers, result cards, and “play again” buttons that make sessions feel alive.
- Instant coverage checks ensure the House can always pay out before a game starts, so wins never bounce.

## Currency & Economy Basics
- **Chips** are the primary casino currency. Winnings pay out in chips straight from the House vault.
- **Credits** are your personal stake. Games spend credits first, burning them on losses before dipping into chips.
- The **shared ledger** keeps balances, jackpots, and job earnings synced across every guild—no matter where you log in, you pick up right where you left off.
- Need a refill? Claim `/dailyspin`, vote with `/vote`, clock in with `/job`, or submit `/request type:buyin amount:<chips>` when staff-approved bankrolls make sense.

## Game Lineup
- **Ride the Bus** – Survive four quick-fire rounds for up to a 10× payout, or cash out early if the cards look dicey.
- **Blackjack** – Choose between the high-roller and casual tables, split, double, and chase chip-rich blackjacks with smart House cover logic.
- **Slots** – 20-line video slots with wilds, scatters, a pay-table button, and “Spin Again” prompts for rapid streaks.
- **Roulette (American)** – Layer inside/outside bets, confirm the board, and watch the live reveal complete with detailed result embeds.
- **Dice War** – Roll 2d6 against the House; doubles on a winning roll double your payout.
- **Horse Race** – Five horses sprint through ten stages with countdowns, swap fees, and richly narrated race cards.
- **Texas Hold’em** – Host a private table with automatic channel setup, turn timers, side pots, and rake readouts.

## Jobs & Progression
- Three launch jobs—Bartender, Dealer, and Bouncer—deliver five-stage skill tests that pay chips based on accuracy and speed.
- Stamina charges regenerate every two hours. Spend them wisely to push for perfect scores and higher XP.
- Each job tracks its own rank ladder. Promotions unlock heftier guaranteed payouts and better tip ceilings.
- The `/job` panel shows stamina, recent shifts, role-specific stats, and quick-start buttons so you can jump into your next shift instantly.

## Daily Rewards & Competitive Play
- `/dailyspin` hands out a free reward wheel every 24 hours; vote bonuses stack even more chips.
- Leaderboards pull straight from the global ledger, spotlighting chip whales, job grinders, and streak champions across every guild.
- Rich result cards outline net gains, losses, burned credits, and House earnings so you always know how the session ended.

## Player Tools You’ll Use Constantly
- `/balance [user]` – Check your stack or peek at a friend’s totals (with respectful permissions).
- `/leaderboard [limit]` – See who’s dominating the global floor this week.
- `/job stats [user]` – Review role ranks, recent runs, and stamina at a glance.
- `/request type:cashout amount:<chips>` – Ask staff for a cash-out when you’re ready to bank your winnings.
- `/help` – Browse every command and learn the basics without leaving Discord.

## Fair Play, Safety, and Comfort
- Sessions expire after two minutes of inactivity to avoid stale bets; when that happens the bot closes the game cleanly and posts a summary.
- Game logs channel big payouts, cash requests, and job settlements so communities can audit the action transparently.
- Privacy controls respect player data—when you request deletion, the bot removes ledger balances, job history, vote rewards, and more across every guild.
- Unicode-first buttons and icons keep the experience consistent on any device; no custom emoji dependencies required.
