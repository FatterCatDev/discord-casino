# Pending Update

version: 1.0.0

## Details

🎰 **Welcome to Semuta Casino Bot v1.0.0** — your personal casino concierge, purpose-built for Discord communities that want a vibrant, server-scoped economy. Every guild runs its own house bank, player chip balances, and credit ledgers, so chips never bleed across servers and each casino feels truly bespoke. Players stake credits first (burned on losses), while chips act as the house-backed currency for payouts, buy-ins, and cash-outs. Admins and moderators get a robust toolkit: configure the casino category with `/setcasinocategory`, pick dedicated logs via `/setgamelogchannel` and `/setcashlog`, and steer player requests through `/setrequestchannel`. Need flashier announcements? `/setupdatech` ensures update notes land exactly where you want them — punctuated by the `npm run updatepush` workflow that auto-pings @everyone with the latest highlights. Games span the classics: Blackjack (split/double logic), Roulette with interactive bet builders, Slots, Dice War, Ride the Bus, plus full Texas Hold’em tables that spawn and clean up their own channels. Sessions auto-expire to keep chats tidy, result embeds summarize action, and optional Kitten Mode re-skins the persona for playful communities. Setup is simple: invite the bot, fill out `.env`, run `npm run deploy`, set your channels, and watch chips flow.
