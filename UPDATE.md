# Pending Update

version: 1.2.6

## Changes

- Added a centralized chip formatter so every player-facing chip amount now renders with the :chips: emoji and updated all embeds, system replies, and docs to use it.
- Simplified the `/cartel dealers` list UI by removing IDs/status/upkeep text, showing only essential stats, surfacing dealer slot usage at the top, and auto-graying inactive dealers.
- Cartel sell mini-game ticks now fire every 1.5 seconds for faster runs.
