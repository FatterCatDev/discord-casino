# Pending Update

## Changes
- Horse Race overhaul: randomized horse names with color+horse emoji labels, updated track layout with right-aligned progress, persistent previous-race results, and refreshed copy reflecting stage-based swap fees and 2.5 s stages.
- Horse Race settlements now highlight house net, burned credits, and feed the "Last Race Results" banner in betting view.
- Leaderboard slash command replies ephemerally, keeping standings private to the requester.
- Leaderboards and all game/cash logs now show player display names instead of raw mentions.
- Update push tooling enforces the shared update channel id before broadcasting announcements.
