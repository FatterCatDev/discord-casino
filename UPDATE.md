# Pending Update

version: 1.0.0

## Details

🎰 **Semuta Casino Bot v1.0.0** is your personal casino concierge, purpose-built for Discord communities that want a vibrant, server-scoped economy.

🏦 **Server-Based Finances:** Every guild manages its own house bank, player chip balances, and credit ledgers, so chips never bleed across servers and each casino stays bespoke.

💸 **Dual-Currency Flow:** Players stake credits first (burned on losses), while chips handle payouts, buy-ins, and cash-outs with full house-backed accountability.

🛠️ **Admin Toolkit:** Configure `/setcasinocategory`, `/setgamelogchannel`, `/setcashlog`, and `/setrequestchannel` to stand up a casino hub in minutes. Point updates with `/setupdatech` so @everyone hears about the latest upgrades right inside Discord.

🎮 **Games Galore:** Enjoy Blackjack (split/double logic), Roulette with interactive bet builders, Slots, Dice War, Ride the Bus, and full Texas Hold’em tables that create and clean up their own channels.

🧹 **Smart Sessions:** Auto-expiring sessions, tidy result embeds, and optional Kitten Mode keep channels fresh while delivering the vibe your community craves.

⚙️ **Quick Setup:** Invite the bot, run the setup slash commands, confirm channel permissions, and let the chips start flowing.
