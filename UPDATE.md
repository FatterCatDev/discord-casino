version: 1.0.0

## Changes

- 🎉 **Semuta Casino Bot v1.0.0 is live!** A full-featured casino experience tailored to your own Discord server.
- 🧩 **Modular Games Suite:** Blackjack, Roulette, Slots, Dice War, Ride the Bus, and full Texas Hold’em tables with channel management.
- 🏛️ **Server-Scoped Economy:** Each guild tracks its own House bank, player chips, and credits—no cross-server bleed.

- 💬 **Kitten Mode Persona:** Optional sassy alter ego for playful servers—switchable per guild.

- 🧪 **Robust Session Handling:** Per-user state, auto-expiring sessions, and game result embeds to keep channels tidy.
- 🔐 **Security-First Defaults:** Role-based access checks, optional owner overrides, and environment-driven secrets.
